In this assigment i tried to create a simple family of 2 parents and two children, although i couldn't add more to it since i was not able to understand the islamic law of inheritance. to get the results a simple input of write_inheritance_list('name of the person that died') will output the ratio of the inheritance of each mamber of the family.
